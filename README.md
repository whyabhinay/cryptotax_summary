# CryptoTax Summary Library

A Python library for summarizing Coinbase crypto transaction data for tax reporting. It categorizes gains and losses as short-term or long-term, specifically designed for users with more than 4,000 transactions that cannot be uploaded to TurboTax.

## Important Note

Ensure that you use the Gain/Loss Statement as the input file for accurate processing.
